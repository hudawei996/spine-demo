/** Controls how the skeleton of a {@link SpineView} is animated and rendered.
 *
 * Upon initialization of a {@link SpineView}, the provided {@code onInitialized} callback method is called once. This method can
 * be used to set up the initial animation(s) of the skeleton, among other things.
 *
 * After initialization is complete, the {@link SpineView} is rendered at the screen refresh rate. In each frame, the
 * {@link AnimationState} is updated and applied to the {@link Skeleton}.
 *
 * Next, the optionally provided method {@code onBeforeUpdateWorldTransforms} is called, which can modify the skeleton before its
 * current pose is calculated using {@link Skeleton#updateWorldTransform(Skeleton.Physics)}. After
 * {@link Skeleton#updateWorldTransform(Skeleton.Physics)} has completed, the optional {@code onAfterUpdateWorldTransforms} method
 * is called, which can modify the current pose before rendering the skeleton.
 *
 * Before the skeleton's current pose is rendered by the {@link SpineView}, the optional {@code onBeforePaint} is called, which
 * allows rendering backgrounds or other objects that should go behind the skeleton on the {@link Canvas}. The {@link SpineView}
 * then renders the skeleton's current pose and finally calls the optional {@code onAfterPaint}, which can render additional
 * objects on top of the skeleton.
 *
 * The underlying {@link AndroidTextureAtlas}, {@link SkeletonData}, {@link Skeleton}, {@link AnimationStateData},
 * {@link AnimationState}, and {@link AndroidSkeletonDrawable} can be accessed through their respective getters to inspect and/or
 * modify the skeleton and its associated data. Accessing this data is only allowed if the {@link SpineView} and its data have
 * been initialized and have not been disposed of yet.
 *
 * By default, the widget updates and renders the skeleton every frame. The {@code pause} method can be used to pause updating and
 * rendering the skeleton. The {@link SpineController#resume()} method resumes updating and rendering the skeleton. The
 * {@link SpineController#isPlaying()} getter reports the current state. */
